*tips1: Less passive voice*    
*tips2: Don't use 'the' before thinking*

##  1. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:

Nowadays, children rely too much on the technology, like computers, smartphone, video games, for fun and entertainment; 
Playing simpler toys or playing outside with friends would be better for the children's development.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

### For the argument

1) increase in physical activity and lead to healthy lifestyle.  
- stepping away from electronic gadgets and into outdoor activities   
- accelerate their eye-hand coordinations from manipulating toys and cooperate with teammates during some sports games such as basketball and swimming    
- gain more muscle tone from jogging and riding bicycles or even balancing on skateboards    

**Conclusion: While spending much time staring at screens will impair their normal vision and lead to a **sedentary lifestyle**,
increased outdoor activities directly translates into increased physical health.**

2） be better at social interactions and increasing social skills    
- Play with peers will unintentionally nurture the basic skills of social life such as **compassion** and **taking turns**    
- Children who interact with others become more **articulate** in speaking a wide range of ideas and expressing themselves    
- Peer interactions are crucial for them to formulate friendship with others, try to trust others and be trustful and even forging a self-identity by seeking like-minded companions

*Hint from GRE:*    
In adolescence, peer interactions are crucial in forging a self-identity.   

　　To be sure, this process often plays out in **cliquish social behavior** as a means of defining and **shoring up**ni the sense of self.

　　Kids will seek out like-minded companions, and spurn others who seem different.

　　But when kept within reasonable bounds, this in-group clustering generally evolves into a more mature friendship pattern.
  
3)  have a working basis for many practical sciences    
- form the backbone of later study or research
- learn about science and the principles in a more interacted way rather than rote definition of tedious jargons or watch the video showing the experiments.
