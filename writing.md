*tips1: Less passive voice*    
*tips2: Don't use 'the' before thinking*

##  1. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:

Nowadays, children rely too much on the technology, like computers, smartphone, video games, for fun and entertainment; 
Playing simpler toys or playing outside with friends would be better for the children's development.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

### For the argument

1) increase in physical activity and lead to healthy lifestyle.  
- stepping away from electronic gadgets and into outdoor activities   
- accelerate their eye-hand coordinations from manipulating toys and cooperate with teammates during some sports games such as basketball and swimming    
- gain more muscle tone from jogging and riding bicycles or even balancing on skateboards    

**Conclusion: While spending much time staring at screens will impair their normal vision and lead to a **sedentary lifestyle**,
increased outdoor activities directly translates into increased physical health.**

2) be better at social interactions and increasing social skills    
- Play with peers will unintentionally nurture the basic skills of social life such as **compassion** and **taking turns**    
- Children who interact with others become more **articulate** in speaking a wide range of ideas and expressing themselves    
- Peer interactions are crucial for them to formulate friendship with others, try to trust others and be trustful and even forging a self-identity by seeking like-minded companions

*Hint from GRE:*    
In adolescence, peer interactions are crucial in forging a self-identity.   

　　To be sure, this process often plays out in **cliquish social behavior** as a means of defining and **shoring up**ni the sense of self.

　　Kids will seek out like-minded companions, and spurn others who seem different.

　　But when kept within reasonable bounds, this in-group clustering generally evolves into a more mature friendship pattern.
  
3)  have a working basis for many practical sciences    
- form the backbone of later study or research
- learn about science and the principles in a more ~~interacted way~~ **tangible way** rather than rote definition of tedious jargons or watch the video showing the experiments.

### Against the argument

- access to technology    
- perform intricate tasks    
- may seem like a  fra-fetched claim
- boring drills (seems like another expression of practice)     
- from early stage/age 








##  2. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:

All scientific discoveries should be shared to all scientists around the world; Governments and businesses should not keep any scientific discoveries secret.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

### For the argument


- Scientific inventions and discoveries should be the property of world    
- impede scientific progress / inhibit the development of technologies    

1) avoid unnecessary repetition of the foudation work
- Sharing discoveries saves time and energy because scientists do not have to repeat the same experiments   
**For example, by sharing the patterns for making the Mars Curiosity rover, NASA has enabled other scientists to improve on the design and make rovers that will endure even more rigorous conditions than those encountered by Curiosity**   

- Sharing discoveries allows scientists to confirm data and establish whether theories are on target(For example, an experimental drug must undergo rigorous testing before it is approved. If several scientists in different areas are pursuing the same line of research, they can compare results obtained under different conditions.)
- Sharing discoveries could potentially save thousands of lives and solve some of the difficult health and environmental problems that plague the world today.

**Conclusion

### Against the argument
- Not nessessary to reveal the data
- Patent the results to cover the expenses, encourage companies to invest in original research.
- Some may cause serious harm if they are in the wrong hands.
  - can be misused as devices for terrorism.
  - should restrict access to the knowledge
  
  

## Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Physical exercise is important to older people than to younger people.       
_as a self-saving output in the last few days_

Physical exercise has long been a significant way to improve our healthy status and lifestyles. While considering its costly time inputs and benifits for our physical health, most people deem that physical exercise is more important to older people, I believe exercises for younger people is more necessary, of great magnitude and has long-term rewards when it ultimately forms a lifelong habit.    

Firstly, there's no denying that doing physical exercise can help us stay healthy. Since basicaly older people may have more health issues, most people emphasize the importance of exercise for the old. Nevertheless, due to nowadays fast life pace and unhealthy lifestyle, we had to admit that more and more youngsters have trouble with their physical health status. The increasing needs for screen usage have shraply impaired younger people's eyesights, leading a bunch of adolescents end up with high myopia and have to wear glasses at a very early stage. The sendentary studying and working life also leads to more problem with bones and muscles. Lacking of exercise also weakened their immune system and makes the young vulnerable to deadly virus. Moreover, comparing to most of the health problem cause by aging that cannot be cured such as cancer, most of the common illness happened among youngsters can be released or even overcome through effective exercise. Therefore, to emphasize the importance of exercising seems urgent and necessary.      

Secondly, exercise not only serves as a way of building physical health, it's also an effective way to release the mental health and form a healthy mind. Old people may regard doing exercise as one of the interesting recreations among their careless retiring life, while doing exercise becomes the straightforward method for most young people to release their pressure and escape from their tedious and stressful routine. Most of the industrial companies today are equipped with fitness clubs for their employees to relax themselves after or during working, and the prevalent of night-jogging clubs and the upsurge interests of practicing yoga also can be strong evidence of younger individual's badly need for exercise as a way reducing their burdens and strains. From this perspective, the importance for the young to exercise still overweighs advocating the older to practice.     

Last but not least, when exercising becomes a meaningful habit, the beneficial cycle for young people is more longer than **the elderly**. In other words, if a younger person or adolescent forms the habit of exercising at a early age, he/she will still maintain it when getting older. Taking my grandpa as an example, he formed the habit of swimming when he was still at college, and at that time swimming was just a way of relaxation from courses and projects. Since then swimming has become a weekly routine and till now he still goes to the swimming pool twice a week. Moreover, comparing with his peers, my grandfather has fewer healthy problems and is still as energetic as a young man. Though there are other healthy life patterns can be taken accounts for his health status, the habit of swimming become the foudation of regular and disciplined lifestyle. As a result, no matter what's the purpose for physical exercise, the earlier time to start, the more benifits will be received. That's the reason why I strongly advocate the magnitude of physical exercise among young generations.

All in all, exercise should be a life-long salutary lifestyle that benefits us in both physical and mental ways. But when addressing the importance of doing physical exercise, the magnitude of advocating youger people becomes more important and can lead to long-term advantage of our life.
