*tips1: Less passive voice*    
*tips2: Don't use 'the' before thinking*

##  1. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:

Nowadays, children rely too much on the technology, like computers, smartphone, video games, for fun and entertainment; 
Playing simpler toys or playing outside with friends would be better for the children's development.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

### For the argument

1) increase in physical activity and lead to healthy lifestyle.  
- stepping away from electronic gadgets and into outdoor activities   
- accelerate their eye-hand coordinations from manipulating toys and cooperate with teammates during some sports games such as basketball and swimming    
- gain more muscle tone from jogging and riding bicycles or even balancing on skateboards    

**Conclusion: While spending much time staring at screens will impair their normal vision and lead to a **sedentary lifestyle**,
increased outdoor activities directly translates into increased physical health.**

2) be better at social interactions and increasing social skills    
- Play with peers will unintentionally nurture the basic skills of social life such as **compassion** and **taking turns**    
- Children who interact with others become more **articulate** in speaking a wide range of ideas and expressing themselves    
- Peer interactions are crucial for them to formulate friendship with others, try to trust others and be trustful and even forging a self-identity by seeking like-minded companions

*Hint from GRE:*    
In adolescence, peer interactions are crucial in forging a self-identity.   

　　To be sure, this process often plays out in **cliquish social behavior** as a means of defining and **shoring up**ni the sense of self.

　　Kids will seek out like-minded companions, and spurn others who seem different.

　　But when kept within reasonable bounds, this in-group clustering generally evolves into a more mature friendship pattern.
  
3)  have a working basis for many practical sciences    
- form the backbone of later study or research
- learn about science and the principles in a more ~~interacted way~~ **tangible way** rather than rote definition of tedious jargons or watch the video showing the experiments.

### Against the argument

- access to technology    
- perform intricate tasks    
- may seem like a  fra-fetched claim
- boring drills (seems like another expression of practice)     
- from early stage/age 








##  2. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:

All scientific discoveries should be shared to all scientists around the world; Governments and businesses should not keep any scientific discoveries secret.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

### For the argument


- Scientific inventions and discoveries should be the property of world    
- impede scientific progress / inhibit the development of technologies    

1) avoid unnecessary repetition of the foudation work
- Sharing discoveries saves time and energy because scientists do not have to repeat the same experiments   
**For example, by sharing the patterns for making the Mars Curiosity rover, NASA has enabled other scientists to improve on the design and make rovers that will endure even more rigorous conditions than those encountered by Curiosity**   

- Sharing discoveries allows scientists to confirm data and establish whether theories are on target(For example, an experimental drug must undergo rigorous testing before it is approved. If several scientists in different areas are pursuing the same line of research, they can compare results obtained under different conditions.)
- Sharing discoveries could potentially save thousands of lives and solve some of the difficult health and environmental problems that plague the world today.

**Conclusion

### Against the argument
- Not nessessary to reveal the data
- Patent the results to cover the expenses, encourage companies to invest in original research.
- Some may cause serious harm if they are in the wrong hands.
  - can be misused as devices for terrorism.
  - should restrict access to the knowledge
